<p>This addon absolutely requires <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/total-rp-3">Total RP 3</a> as it is a module for such. What it does is allow the ability to change the Target and Player unit frame names, text color, and backdrop color for readability. It will also add a button which can be toggled on/of that will allow opening your own or your targets profile, with a few options to move the button around a bit. There is also the option for selected colors to apply to NPCs to help with readability, however it's very limited.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be a replacement of the default unit frames, but rather a bridge between them and the Total RP 3 addon. For the time being, this is untested with other unit frame addons and may be incompatible, however in time I may make compatibility options for the most popular projects.</p>
